### Nvidia Store
This is a shopping cart made with react and tailwindCSS without backend, it doesn't store items in any database. I attempted to emulate pretty much everything from official Nvidia store, items when they are being added to the cart doesn't affect any UI interactions as they're component itself, products sections contains cart where number of items currently in the cart can be seen, dropdown selection however can be a little bonkers, user can't fix that but what user can do is.
#### User Can:
- Add/Remove Items in Cart
- Navigate between pages with a navigation bar (shown on both routes)
- Interact with homepage/products page
